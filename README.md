## Getting Started

To get started with **IoT Elements Node**, you can download the latest release from our [Releases section](https://github.com/kebunonethird/iot-elements-node/releases). Download the appropriate file and execute it to set up the elements in your project.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of HTML and JavaScript.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kebunonethird/iot-elements-node.git

## Usage

Once you have installed the components, you can start using them in your HTML files. Below is a simple example of how to include an IoT element in your project:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>IoT Example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/iot-elements.css">
</head>
<body>
    <iot-light-switch></iot-light-switch>
    <script src="path/to/iot-elements.js"></script>
